**Situation** <br />
The local pizzeria faced challenges in understanding its sales patterns and identifying key drivers of revenue. With various types of pizzas, different sales days, and varying customer preferences, the pizzeria needed a comprehensive way to analyze and visualize this data to make informed business decisions. The goal of this project was to develop a Power BI dashboard that provided detailed insights into sales performance, enabling the pizzeria to track daily and monthly trends, identify popular and underperforming pizzas, and optimize resource allocation for peak times. This project aimed to enhance the pizzeria's ability to make data-driven decisions, ultimately improving sales and operational efficiency.

**Task**<br />
As the lead data analyst for this personal project, I designed and implemented a dashboard to help users explore key sales metrics for a local pizzeria. Collaborating closely with the Store Manager to identify relevant data sources and crucial metrics, I utilized Power BI, a powerful data visualization tool, to create an interactive dashboard. This tool enables users and managers to explore data in real-time, providing valuable insights into sales performance.

**Action**<br />
To create the dashboard, I utilized a dataset from Kaggle, focusing on key metrics to analyze pizza sales. The dashboard features interactive filtering options, allowing users to view data for specific months, days of the week, and different types of pizzas. I incorporated various visualization types, including bar graphs, doughnut graphs, funnel charts, and area charts.
The key metrics included in the dashboard are:<br />
**•	Total Revenue:** Sum of the total price of orders.<br />
**•	Average Order Value:** Average amount spent per order, calculated as total revenue divided by the total number of orders.<br />
**•	Total Pizzas Sold:** Sum of all quantities of pizzas sold.<br />
**•	Total Orders:** Total number of orders placed.<br />
**•	Average Pizzas Per Order:** Average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated as the total number of pizzas divided by the total number of orders.<br />
This comprehensive and interactive dashboard enables users and managers to explore the data in real-time, providing valuable insights into sales performance and trends.<br />

**Result**<br />
The dashboard has been a tremendous success, offering valuable insights into sales trends at the local pizzeria. It has become an essential tool for the owners, enabling them to track which days, times, and specific pizzas generate the most revenue and identify areas requiring additional resources. Notable quantifiable results of the project include:<br />
**•	Enhanced Transparency and Accountability:** The dashboard provides clear, detailed insights into daily sales, helping the owners understand which pizzas are popular and which are not. This information supports strategic decision-making for promotions and deals on various pizza types, based on their sales performance.<br />
**•	Improved Coordination:** Managers and staff can now better plan their schedules by identifying the busiest days of the week. This optimization ensures that an adequate number of workers are on shift during peak times, enhancing efficiency and customer service.<br />
**•	Accelerated Sales Strategy Development:** The comprehensive data from the dashboard has accelerated progress in identifying changes needed to boost pizza sales. The detailed month-to-month sales analysis supports informed decisions to drive higher sales and revenue.<br />

**Reflection**<br />
This project taught me the critical role of data visualization in transforming complex sales data into clear and actionable insights. It emphasized the value of using tools like Power BI to create interactive dashboards that facilitate data-driven decision-making. In the future, I would aim to incorporate more real-time data sources to provide even fresher insights and further enhance the dashboard's usability to make it more intuitive for users of varying technical backgrounds.
